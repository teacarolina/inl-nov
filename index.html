<!--Hey guys, 
This week we'll be discussing the concept of "Youtubability" -
another important game guideline.
Youtubability
A key driver of youtubability is the clarity of your gameplay
to a potential player.
Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential
of your game by working on getting the lowest possible CPIs
for your games. 
Many elements can be used to make your game clearer:
For instance, ask yourself if a user's interaction with the game
is evident, for example, can she tell which character she controls?
Is the objective clear? Does it look fun to play?
Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after
10 seconds (too long!).
Make sure the use colours to help indicate the gameplay rules.
For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are clearly
contrasted (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random
people in the street, it is interesting to show them
the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to
understand their expectaions from the video vs. the actual game they try.
Make it obvious with visual elements that help understand the objective and
controls of the game, like with the target used
in Viatcheslav Tarasov's Purple Diver or Fabrika Games' Draw Car
with the space dedicated to drawing.

People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their phone's Facebook feed,
everything will seem smaller than when displated in Unity or as a video on your
computer screen. You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable
if someone watches it on a small screen. With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds,
this is an accelerated elevator pitch!
Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because
it has an attractive thumbnail - it's the same idea for your game videos.-->
